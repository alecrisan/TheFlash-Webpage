<h2> Crossovers </h2>

<article>
<p> The Flash has been a part of several Crossovers that included other shows from the Arrowverse, such as Arrow, Supergirl and Legends Of Tomorrow. </p>
<p> But the one that everyone is waiting for is Crisis on Infinite Earths, which will be released this fall.</p>
</article>

<article>

During this comic book crossover, Supergirl also died – in a scene that was deliberately echoed visually by the season two premiere of her own show after it moved to The CW.</p>
